 *  Consider an example of book shop which sells books & video tapes. Itâ€™s modeled by Book &
	Tape classes. These two classes are inherited from the abstract class called Media. The Media
	class has common data members such as title & publication. The Book class has data
	member for storing a no. of pages in a book & Tape class has the playing time in a tape. Each
	class will have method such as read ( ) & show ( ). Write a program that models this class
	hierarchy & processes objects using reference to base class only.
